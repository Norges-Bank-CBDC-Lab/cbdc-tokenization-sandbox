# Known Issues

## Current Besu baseline is intentionally conservative
- The local sandbox is still pinned to Clique proof-of-authority consensus and
  the London EVM milestone.
- This is intentional: newer EVM milestones and QBFT have not yet been
  re-validated end-to-end across contract deployment, fee handling, and
  Blockscout behavior in this repo.
- Planned follow-up: move the sandbox to QBFT and a newer milestone after the
  full local workflow has been retested.

## Besu + Solidity `PUSH0` opcode
- Contract deployment on the local Besu network can fail with
  `Invalid opcode: 0x5f` if the chain or compiler configuration drifts away
  from the current London baseline.
- See `infra/DEVELOPMENT.md` for the current genesis settings and the
  supported local chain baseline.

## Foundry + Besu fee settings
- Some deployments require explicit gas settings to avoid
  `upfront cost exceeds account balance`.
- Example working flags are documented in `infra/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Foundry signature cache warning (sandbox)
- In constrained environments, Foundry may warn about failing to write
  `~/.foundry/cache/signatures`.
- This does not affect compilation results; ensure the cache directory is
  writable if you want a clean warning-free build.
